Theo OpenVoice is a unified runtime for voice pipelines. It orchestrates STT and TTS engines behind an OpenAI-compatible API, with streaming, VAD, preprocessing, and session management built in.

## Why Theo

- One runtime for batch and streaming speech
- Full-duplex STT and TTS on the same WebSocket
- Engine-agnostic architecture for Faster-Whisper, WeNet, and Kokoro
- Production-grade session manager with recovery and backpressure

## Quick start

```bash
pip install theo-openvoice[server,grpc,faster-whisper]

theo serve

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F file=@audio.wav \
  -F model=faster-whisper-large-v3
```
